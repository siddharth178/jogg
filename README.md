# jogg
This is an attempt to write REST API that tracks jogging times of users and also tried to fetch corresponding weather information.

Things to consider
* User creation, login, roles, and role based authentication.
* Track date, distance, time, and location of each jogg entry.
* If we can fetch weather information, that would be great.
* Then typical things like reporting, pagination and adv. query filters.
